							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Despite being heavily discriminated against and having rights revoked for simply being a Muslim immigrant, they do not pose a threat to society (Pitt, 2011). In fact, they have become more commonly victimized by other groups within the United States due to the public perception of them being a threat to national security (Pitt, 2011). In 2015, Gould and Klor examined the ef-fects that the 9/11 attacks had on the Muslim population in America and found there had been a rise in hate crimes towards Muslims after the attacks (Gould & Klor, 2016). Specifically, there was a rise from 28 reported occurrences to 481 reported occurrences from the years 2000 to 2001 (Gould & Klor, 2016).</p>
							<p>Gould and Klor also found a significant difference in assimilation rates among Muslim Americans before and after 9/11. The rate of Muslim American assimilation was slower after the backlash they received (Gould & Klor, 2016). This was evident in the greater chances of intra-marriage, the lower female labor force participation, and the lower English proficiency (Gould & Klor, 2016).</p>
