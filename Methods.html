							<p>We are currently researching directly by revwiewing United States policy that has been enacted such as Executive Order 13769, aka "The Muslim Ban", and the USA PATRIOT Act.  These policies have rhetoric that describes whom they view as national threats to society.  We are also doing a thorough content analysis of each policy that has been directly linked to those with Middle Eastern countries and counting cases that have Muslim American immigrant defendants.  Another way we are review these cases is through a quantitative content analysis that looks for the frequency of derogatory and controversial terms pertaining to Muslim American immigrants.  For example, cases like that of the Boim v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development Case or the Guantanamo Bay Supreme Court cases that expand throughout the years of 2001 to present. The intent of reviewing case law is to evaluate the verbiage used and how it inherently promotes discrimination towards that of Muslim American immigrants. In the United States Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit's case text of Boim v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief & Development, decided in 2008, the word “terrorism” appears 112 times and the word “terrorist” is found 123 times in the court reasoning.  This court case is not used in teh results section as it is just an example of our methodology.</p>
                            <p>These policies and case rhetoric are presenting how the justice system views Muslim American individuals, while additionally taking away the rights of Muslim American Immigrants despite their due diligence to be “good” citizens of the United States.  Some of the key words that we are searching for in our content analysis are national security, 9/11, terrorism, Muslim, Middle Eastern, Arab Americans, etc.  This is pulling up articles that breakdown policies and their direct impact on Muslim American immigrants or if there is even an impact.  One of the questions we searched was “Muslim American immigrants and United States policy?” to see what results would be yielded. It found approximately 3,100,000,000 articles with these key words if just simply googled. Our group then had to move our search away from the basic version of Google to Google Scholar to ensure all articles we use are peer reviewed and accurate. When the same search was conducted on Google Scholar there were only 395,000 articles that appeared compared to the early result of 3,100,000,000 articles. One way we are reviewing the Google Scholar articles through is a qualitative content analysis.  We are locating the words Muslim, Middle Eastern, Arab Americans and look at the words that follow or precede them.  We looking to see if phrases appear next to them such as terrorist, bombers, angry, wealthy, and more.  The articles we are primarily reviewing are state and national laws that appear on Google Scholar.  These laws have words that indicate whether the laws are appearing to promote discrimination and view Muslim American immigrants as the words above; such as the terms we mentioned of terrorist, angry, and more. The correlation between rhetoric and policy should reveal that it has an extremely influent impact on the perception of minority groups within our justice system.  This would depict how the policies have created negative connotations that permit the law to discriminate without any public backlash.</p>
