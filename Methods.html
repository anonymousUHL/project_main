    <h2>Our Methods</h2>
    <p>We are currently researching directly by revwiewing United States policy that has been enacted such as Executive Order 13769, aka "The Muslim Ban", and the USA PATRIOT Act.  These policies have rhetoric that describes whom they view as national threats to society.  We are also doing a thorough content analysis of each policy that has been directly linked to those with Middle Eastern countries and counting cases that have Muslim American immigrant defendants.  Another way we are review these cases is through a quantitative content analysis that looks for the frequency of derogatory and controversial terms pertaining to Muslim American immigrants.  </p>
    <h2>From our document (Neil will delete)</h2>
    We want to directly research our research by reviewing United States policy that has been enact-ed such as Executive Order N. 3, aka “The Muslim Ban”, and the Patriot Act. These policies will have rhetoric that describes whom they view as national threats to society. We plan to do a thor-ough content analysis of each policy that has been directly linked to those with Middle Eastern connection and count cases that have Muslim American immigrant de¬fendants. Another way to review these cases is through a quantitative content analysis that looks for the frequency of de-rogatory and controversial terms pertaining to Muslim American immigrants. For example, cases like that of the Boim v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development Case or the Guan-tanamo Bay Supreme Court cases that expand throughout the years of 2001 to present. The in-tent of reviewing case law is to evaluate the verbiage used and how it inherently promotes dis-crimination towards that of Muslim American immigrants. In the United States Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit’s case text of Boim v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief & Development, decid-ed in 2008, the word “terrorism” appears 112 times and the word “terrorist” is found 123 times in the court reasoning. This court case will not be used in the results section as it is just an example of a methodology we plan to use with other important cases.
These policies and case rhetoric will present how the justice system views that of Muslim American individuals, while additionally taking away the rights of Muslim American Immigrants despite their due dili¬gence to be “good” citizens of the United States. Some of the key words that we plan to search for in our content analysis are national security, 9/11, terrorism, Muslim, Middle Eastern, Arab Amer¬icans, etc.…  This should pull up articles that breakdown policies and their direct impact on Muslim American immigrants or if there is even an impact. One of the questions we searched was “Muslim American immigrants and United States policy?” to see what results would be yielded via google chrome. It found approximately 3,100,000,000 articles with these key words if just simply googled. Our group then had to move our search away from the basic version of Google Chrome to Google Scholar to ensure all articles we use are peer re-viewed and accurate. When the same search was conducted on Google Scholar there were only 395,000 articles that appeared compared to the early result of 3,100,000,000 articles. One way we will review the Google Scholar articles through a qualitative content analysis. We will locate the words Muslim, Middle Eastern, Arab Americans and look at the words that follow or pre-cede them. We expect to see phrases appear next to them such as terrorist, bombers, angry, wealthy, and more. The articles we will primarily be reviewing will be state and national laws that appear on Google Scholar. These laws should have words that indicate whether the laws are ap-pearing to promote discrimination and view Muslim American immigrants as the words above; such as the terms we mentioned of terrorist, angry, and more. The correlation between rhetoric and policy should reveal that it has an extremely influent impact on the perception of minority groups within our justice system. This would depict how the policies have created negative con-notations that permit the law to discriminate without any public backlash. 
Overall, the narrowing of searches will continue to occur as we choose different key-words to intermingle, and our group will plan to review both articles that support and refute our research question. Upon, reviewing both sides we will be able to make a well-rounded content analysis that truly echoes the sentiments of our justice system towards Muslim American immi-grants.
